# wordelm

## What

A clone of Wordle written in Elm.

## Why

So that I could entertain myself by learning something new.

## Running Locally

1. Ensure Elm is installed
2. `npm run build`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Try it

`main` automatically deploys to [wordelm.r-cha.dev](https://wordelm.r-cha.dev/)

## Look at it
